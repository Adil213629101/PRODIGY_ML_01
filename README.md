# House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a reliable model for predicting house prices. The features considered for prediction include the square footage of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Results

The linear regression model has been trained and evaluated, yielding the following results:

- **R2 Score for Training Data:** 0.9811711977740941
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for Training Data:** 10870.380011724283

- **R2 Score for Validation Data:** 0.8901571073840797
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for Validation Data:** 26574.233034834433
